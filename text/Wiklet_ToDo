This list reflects the [http://rrt.sc3d.org/Reuben_Thomas|author]'s priorities. If you'd like to help, or you have any other changes you'd like to see, please $email{contact me}.

   * Add macros equivalent to all markup.
   * Add web interface for rollback, configuration and management (e.g. restart). This needs authentication.
   * Support more document types.
   * Use authentication and extra document types to allow editing of the templates and CGI scripts. Expand this to allowing Wiklet to present a user's entire home directory.
   * Use ideas from [http://hypertext.sourceforge.net/silk/userGuide.shtml|Silk], [http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?LinkDatabase|LinkDatabase] and [http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?TouchGraphWikiBrowser|TouchGraph].
   * Rewrite in OCaml or Java.
   * Make more secure. In particular, ensure that URLs and file paths are always clean, preferably at the datatype level. Look for other potential security problems.
   * Optionally pass editing back to the client.
   * Support the @LINK@ element (should replace the navigation bar).
