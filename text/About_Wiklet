About Wiklet
###

[Wiklet] is a simple [Wiki] that offers little in the way of advanced functionality; instead it concentrates on being easy to install by users with modest computer skills, and easy to use even for novices. It comes with complete documentation (you're reading it!).

Wiklet

   * can be installed on almost any web server
