Smut Text Formatting
###

Various formatting effects can be obtained in wiki pages as follows. Advanced users can add special bits and pieces to pages with [DarkGlass Macros].

_Hint: if you can't get a particular piece of formatting to work, edit this page to see how it's done._

   * Line breaks are significant.
   * Paragraphs are separated by blank lines.
   * A @\#@ at the start of a line marks the line as a comment, which does not appear.
   * @\_text\_@ gives _italics_.
   * @\*text\*@ gives *bold*.
   * @\@text\@@ gives @typewriter face@.
   * Underlining a line with three or more @\#@ makes a

   * @(3 spaces)*@ makes a list item.
   9 @(3 spaces)9@ (or any number) makes a numbered list item.
   <title>@(3 spaces)<title>@ makes a list item with heading @title@.
   * Precede a list with a multiple of three spaces to indent it.
   * A web address, like http://www.c2.com, creates a link to that address.
   * @\[Wiki page name or web address\]@ creates a [http://www.c2.com/|link].
   * @\[Wiki page name or web address\|description\]@ creates a link whose text is @description@.
   * @\[Wiki image or web address of an image\|description\]@ shows the given picture (the name must end in _.jpg_, _.jpeg_,  _.gif_, _.png_ or _.bmp_): [new.gif|NEW!].
   * Precede a formatting character with a backslash (@\\@) to display the character itself (this also applies to backslash itself, so to get a backslash, write it twice).
   * Markup inside braces is ignored, except for backslashes, but spaces and line breaks are reproduced literally.
