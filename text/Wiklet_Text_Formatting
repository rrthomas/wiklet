Wiklet_Text_Formatting
###

Various formatting effects can be obtained in Wiki pages as follows. Advanced users can add special bits and pieces to pages with [Wiklet Macros].

_Hint: if you can't get a particular piece of formatting to work, edit this page to see how it's done._

   * Line breaks are significant
   * Paragraphs are separated by blank lines
   * @\_text\_@ gives _italics_
   * @\*text\*@ gives *bold*
   * @\@text\@@ gives @typewriter face@
   * Underlining a line with three or more @=@ makes a

Section heading
===============

   * Underlining a line with three or more @-@ makes a

Subsection heading
------------------

   * Underlining a line with three or more @~@ makes a

Subsubsection heading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   * A line of three or more @_@ inserts a horizontal rule:

___

   * @(3 spaces)*@ makes a list item
   9 @(3 spaces)9@ (or any number) makes a numbered list item
   <title>@(3 spaces)<title>@ makes a list item with heading @title@
   * Precede a list with a multiple of three spaces to indent it
   * A web address, like http://www.c2.com, creates a link to that address.
   * @\[Wiki page name or web address\]@ creates a [http://www.c2.com/|link]
   * @\[Wiki page name or web address\|description\]@ creates a link whose text is @description@
   * @\[Wiki image or web address of an image\|description\]@ shows the given picture (the name must end in _.jpg_, _.jpeg_,  _.gif_, _.png_ or _.bmp_): [new.gif|NEW!]
   * Precede a formatting character with a backslash (@\\@) to display the character itself (this also applies to backslash itself, so to get a backslash, write it twice)
   * @\{text\}@, where the opening brace is at the start of a line, and the closing brace at the end of a line, gives
{_unformatted_,
  monospaced text}
   * Markup inside braces is ignored, except for backslashes, but spaces and line breaks are reproduced literally
