# Wiklet Navigation

The navigation bar contains:

* Links to the [Wiki]'s main areas
* A link to the [Recent Changes] page, which displays a list of pages that have been updated recently.
* An _Edit Page_ link, which lets you edit the current page's text. The text can be marked up as described in [Wiklet Text Formatting].
