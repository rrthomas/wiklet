# Wiklet Customization

Wiklet can be customized in a number of ways:

* [Wiklet Configuration] deals with basic configuration.
* [Wiklet Organization] gives an overview of the files and URLs used by Wiklet.
* [Wiklet Templates] discusses templates, which are used to generate HTML pages, and can be used as `\$include` files.
* [Wiklet Macros] can be added or modified.
* If you want to add new features to Wiklet, you'll probably want to extend the [Wiklet Actions].
* [Wiklet Git] covers configuration of Git, including editing read-only pages and being notified of changes.
* [Wiklet Security] discusses how to make pages read-only, and password-protect wiki content and Wiklet functions.
