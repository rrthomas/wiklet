# Wiklet

Wiklet is a simple [Wiki], a program that runs on a web server to provide a web site that can be edited from within a web browser. The overall look of the site is controlled by HTML templates; pages in the site can be created and edited by clicking on the edit link that appears on each page. Wiklet pages use a simple and concise [markup format](Wiklet Text Formatting).
