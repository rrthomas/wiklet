Wiklet_Macros
###

Macros are special markup which allow things that are not otherwise possible. A macro call is written @\$macro@ if the macro takes no arguments, or @\$macro\{arg_1_,...,arg_n_\}@ if it does. Commas in macro arguments must be escaped with backslashes. Unwanted arguments may be omitted.

There are two sorts of macro: those built in to [Wiklet], which are documented below, and those provided by a particular [Wiki], which should be documented in [Local Macros]. Extra [Wiklet Macros|macros] can be added in @wiki.pl@; the default @wiki.pl@ gives an example.

Macros are evaluated after Wiki markup, which means that they do not work in certain places, for example as part of a link. Some macros invoke certain [Wiklet Templates].

   <@\$scripturl@>The URL of the Wiki script.
   <@\$homepage@>The name of the Wiki's $link{$browse{$homepage},home page}, suitable for displaying as text.
   <@\$page@>The current page, escaped suitably for use in a URL.
   <@\$pagename@>The name of the current page, suitable for displaying as text.
   <@\$lastmodified@>The date on which the current page was last modified.
   <@\$url\{_path_\}@>Make a URL from a site-relative path.
   <@\$browse\{_page_\}@>The URL required to browse the given page.
   <@\$include\{_file_\}@>Inserts the contents of the given HTML or text file from the templates directory. If the file does not exist, an @abort.htm@ error message is shown with \$text set from @nofile.txt@.
   <@\$link{_url_,_description_}@>Produces a link to the given URL whose displayed text is @_description_@.
   <@\$filesize{_file_}@>Inserts the size of the given file in the download directory.
   <@\$image{_image_,_width_,_height}@>Inserts the given image, which may be either a local file in the @image@ directory or a URL. The width and height are in pixels, or a percentage of the available space.
   <@\$webfile{_file_,_format_}@>Produces a link to the given file in the download directory whose text is @_format_@, followed by the size of the file.
   <@\$pdfpages{_file_}@>Inserts the number of pages in the given PDF file in the download directory.
   <@\$pdffile{_file_}@>Like @\$webfile@, but assumes a PDF file, and inserts the number of pages rather than its size.
   <@\$pdfdoc{_file_,_title_,_comment_}@>Like @\$pdffile@, but inserts the title, in italics, followed by the comment, download link and number of pages in parentheses.
   <@\$webdoc{_file_,_title_,_comment_}@>Like @\$pdfdoc@, but the title is also the name of a Wiki page, to which the title is made a link.
   <@\$counter{_page_}@>Adds a counter, whose value is stored as the contents of page @_page_@. Every time a page containing the macro call is viewed, the counter is incremented by one. @\$counter@ is intended for creating page hit counters, but can also be used to count visits to groups of pages or to a whole site.
   <@\$changes@>Lists recent changes to the wiki, where "recent" is defined by the @\$Recent@ [Wiklet Configuration|configuration variable].
   <@\$action@>The current action being performed.
   <@\$template@>The current template being loaded. Useful for constructing the error message in the @nofile.txt@ [Wiki Templates|template].
   <@\$text@>The body of the page, set for use by certain [Wiklet Templates|templates].
   <@\$undefmacro@>The last undefined macro to be executed. Useful for constructing the error message in the @nomacro.txt@ [Wiklet Templates|template].
   <@\$pageonly@>The value of the @option@ field when the action is @search@.
