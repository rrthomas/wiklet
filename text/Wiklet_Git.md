# Wiklet Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com) is a complex and powerful system, and much of its functionality is not used by Wiklet. The tips below are simple and brief, and you should refer to the [Git documentation](http://git-scm.com/doc) for more details.

=_Automatic notification of page edits_=
    Git can notify you whenever a change is made to a file, for example, using [git-notifier](https://github.com/rsmmr/git-notifier/).
=_Direct editing_=
    You can edit the wiki pages as plain text files directly using Git. Using an editor such as [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs) that has support for Git (and remote file editing, in case you are not running the editor on the web server) makes this particularly convenient. As well as letting you use your favourite editor to edit wiki pages, this is useful if you have [locked pages](Wiklet Security).
