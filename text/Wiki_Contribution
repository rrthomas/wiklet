*Please contribute!*

A [Wiki] is nothing without its users. Don't worry about making mistakes, because the entire history of the [Wiki] is recorded, so mistakes can always be recovered from. (A useful side effect is that vandalism can easily be reversed.)

If you think of a good topic for a new page, add a link to it even if you don't want to (or can't) fill in the page yourself. With luck, someone will see the link and start writing the new page.

Much discussion of what makes a good [Wiki] can be found on the [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GoodStyle|WikiWikiWeb GoodStyle page].
