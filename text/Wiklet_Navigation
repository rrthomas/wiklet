Wiklet Navigation
###

The navigation bar contains:

   * Links to the [Wiki]'s main areas
   * A link to the
$link{$scripturl?action=changes,recent changes} page, which displays a list of pages that have been updated recently.
   * An _Edit Page_ link, which lets you edit the current page's text. The text can be marked up as described in [Wiklet Text Formatting].

Each page's title is a link; follow this link to find all the other pages that refer to the current page.
