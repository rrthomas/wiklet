Wiklet Navigation
###

The navigation bar contains:

   * Links to the [Wiki]'s main areas
   * The search tool:
      * You can type text in here and click on _Search_ to search the [Wiki] for occurrences of your text. A list of matching pages will be displayed.
      * You can list all the pages in the [Wiki] by performing a search without typing anything in the search box.
      * _Hint to advanced users: the search expression is treated as a Perl regexp._
   * A link to the
$link{$scripturl?action=changes,recent changes} page, which displays a list of pages that have been updated recently.
   * An _Edit Page_ link, which lets you edit the current page's text. The text can be marked up as described in [Wiklet Text Formatting].

Each page's title is a link; follow this link to find all the other pages that refer to the current page.
