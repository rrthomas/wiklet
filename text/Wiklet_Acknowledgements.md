# Wiklet Acknowledgements

Alistair Turnbull gave invaluable help early on by discussing and criticising the design, code and documentation, and testing early versions of [Wiklet] as a user and as a webmaster.

Catherine Heyrendt was the first person other than me to use [Wiklet] to run a web site, and gave valuable feedback on the installation process, as well as finding bugs and requesting useful features such as the page hit counter.

Ali Anvariâ€™s interest impelled me to update Wiklet to Markdown.
