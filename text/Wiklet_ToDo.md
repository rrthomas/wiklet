# Wiklet ToDo

This list reflects the [author](https://rrt.sc3d.org)'s priorities. If you'd like to help, or you have any other changes you'd like to see, please [contact me](mailto:rrt@sc3d.org).

   * Merge into DarkGlass by making editing/CVS a DarkGlass plugin.
   * Add macros equivalent to all markup.
   * Add web interface for rollback, configuration and management (e.g. restart). This needs authentication.
   * Support more document types.
   * Use authentication and extra document types to allow editing of the templates and CGI scripts. Expand this to allowing Wiklet to present a user's entire home directory.
   * Use ideas from [Silk](http://hypertext.sourceforge.net/silk/userGuide.shtml), [LinkDatabase](http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?LinkDatabase) and [TouchGraph](http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?TouchGraphWikiBrowser).
   * Make more secure. In particular, ensure that URLs and file paths are always clean, preferably at the datatype level. Look for other potential security problems.
   * Support the `LINK` element (should replace the navigation bar).
