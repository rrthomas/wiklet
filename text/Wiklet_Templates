Wiklet Templates
###

The layout of the [Wiklet] pages can be customized by editing the files in @template@. There is one file for each Wiklet action and some general-purpose files. These are as follows:

   <@view.htm@>Page view template. The page contents is in the @\$text@ [Wiklet Macros|macro].
   <@edit.htm@>Page editing template. The page contents is substituted for the magic macro @\$TEXT@, which is expanded after the other macros, so that its contents is not subject to macro expansion.
   <@abort.htm@>This template is used for error messages. The [Wiklet Macros|macro] @\$text@ contains the error message.
   <@nav.htm@>Contains the navigation bar.
   <@menu.htm@>Contains the menu of links that goes in the navigation bar.
   <@readonly.txt@>The error message displayed when a page cannot be edited.
   <@noaction.txt@>The error message displayed when a non-existent Wiki action is attempted.
   <@nofile.txt@>The error message displayed when a non-existent file is loaded (this is used by the @\$include@ [Wiklet Macros|macro]).
   <@nomacro.txt@>The error message displayed when a non-existent macro is called. The macro @\$undefmacro@ is set to the name of the erroneous macro.

Some other templates are used by particular macros, and are documented with the corresponding macro in [Wiklet Macros].
