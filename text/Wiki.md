# Wiki

A Wiki is a web site that can be [edited by anyone](Wiki Contribution). This enables a group of people to build and modify a web site together. Wikis are particularly good for non-experts, as they are easy to use, and you need nothing more than a web browser to use them.

This Wiki is built on [Wiklet]. To get started using it, see [Wiklet Use]. For more information on Wikis in general, go to http://www.c2.com.
