# Wiklet Organisation

## Distribution

The [distribution archive](Getting Wiklet) is organised as follows:

=`README.md`=
    is a quick introduction.
=`cgi-bin`=
    contains the main Wiklet program `Wiklet.pm`, some helper modules in `VCS` and `RRT`, and the front-end script and configuration file `wiki.pl`.
=`text`=
    contains the contents of the Wiki, which is initially just the Wiklet documentation. Pages can be locked by making them read-only; this can be helpful to make sure that a Wiki's home page, at least, is safe from defacement. It can also be useful for other sensitive information such as CVs.
=`template`=
    contains the HTML templates used to make the Wiki pages. Other static HTML content, such as include files, can be added there.

## Files

The file layout for a [Wiklet] installation follows that of the distribution archive. The directory layout is as follows:

=`DocumentRoot`=
    =`text`=
    =`template`=
    =`image`=
    =`download`=
    <!-- blank -->

The top-level directories `template`, `image` and `download` may have subdirectories created underneath them as convenient. `text` is managed by the Wiklet scripts. `cgi-bin` may live under `DocumentRoot` or elsewhere, depending on the system.

## URLs

[Wiklet]'s use of URLs mirrors the structure of the files it uses on disk, but almost all URLs within the Wiki are generated by [macros](Wiklet Macros) such as a link to a Wiki page, an image or a downloadable file.
