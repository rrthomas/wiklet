# Wiklet Text Formatting

Wiklet pages are written in
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). See the [Markdown syntax page](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for details of how to format pages.

Wiklet has one quirk: to escape an open square bracket, *two* backslashes must be used.

You can also use [macros](Wiklet_Macros).
