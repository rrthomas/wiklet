Wiklet is a simple Wiki, a program that runs on a web server to provide a web site that can be edited from within a web browser. The overall look of the site is controlled by HTML templates; pages in the site can be created and edited by clicking on the edit link that appears on each page.

Wiklet is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3, or, at your option, any later version.
